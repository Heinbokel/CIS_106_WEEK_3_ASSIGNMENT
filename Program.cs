// The following commands should be possible after implementing methods in FilmActorService. 
// The FilmActorService has two repository classes (like databases). Use them as needed to accomplish the tasks below.

// Get list of all actors and write them to the console here (names and ID only, like an actor's snippet).

// Retrieve a single actor and write all of their fields to the console here (all information, like an actor's summary).

// Create a new actor and add it to the actor repository here, then display the new actor's summary.

// The real assignment - Display all films, in full detail, with their list of actors in a tidy report. 
// The actors should be displayed in full detail, not just the actor ID's.
